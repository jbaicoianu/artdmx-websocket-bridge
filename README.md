# What is this?
A simple proof-of-concept of bridging lighting control information from physical or virtual lighting equipment to the web.

# What use is it?
When combined with a web-based 3d engine like JanusXR, A-Frame, etc, this package enables you to control lighting and other effects using the same sort of equipment sound engineers use to coordinate real-world live shows.

 * Synchronize lighting, fog, and other effects in a virtual world with the same effects in a physical location
 * Program lighting sequences for live or pre-recorded events

# Who is responsible for this?
This project was created by James Baicoianu
